# Polygon intersection algorithm

Detecting polygon intersection is essential algorithm in game development and
in interactive computer graphics. In this post I try describe of the polygon
intersection algorithm, including detecting a point belongs to polygon.
Examples are made using a popular game development engine
[Löve2D](https://love2d.org/).
