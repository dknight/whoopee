# About

I am Dmitri from Estonia, Tallinn. My career is about 20 years in front-end development. For the last 10 years, I have been working for
a large Swedish
financial enterprise as a front-end software engineer, specializing
in accessibility and web-components API. To see my full career path, visit
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitri-smirnov-6424b7b9/).

I was very disappointed in front-end development the last time. Especially
in an infinite number of frameworks. (Yeah! I don't like web frameworks).
Bloated NPM packages, Webpack, etc. I remember, even 15 years ago,
it was really fun to make websites. Today, this process is completely
irritating.

While I like programming but despise modern web development, I will write mostly about [Lua](http://lua.org),
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
C, GNU/Linux, etc.

I don't think that anybody will follow and read this blog.
I am writing it just for fun and for myself. It is also good for my
self-education purposes.
