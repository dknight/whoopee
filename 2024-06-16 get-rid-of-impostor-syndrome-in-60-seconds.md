If you read this post, then most probably you have already read a lot of
texts about "impostor syndrome" and you know what it is and how destructive it
might be for your career, life, family, relationships, etc.

I suffered it for many years, it almost ruined my life and career. I read,
maybe, hundreds of articles, consulted with psychologists, and used different
anti-depressants. Nothing helped! Until I accidentally found imaginary
and associative thinking and got healed in one minute. Really!

Enough of words! Let me demonstrate how it works.

## Guide

You are like a pen.

You can draw and write with it in a very good way (or not so good like me):

The pen consists of two parts: a pen handle and a pen refill.

You still can draw and write without the pen handle. Using only a pen refill.
This might be a bit inconvenient, maybe not so good,<br>
**but still can do it!**

The pen handle alone is completely useless, you cannot draw even a line without
a pen refill.

Your core skills, life force, motivation, and health are like a pen refill. If
it is full and ready to act, then you can find a suitable pen handle and start to
draw and write again. If your pen refill is empty, then even together with a
pen handle these both are useless.

Keep your **core** skills up to date, take care of yourself, focus on what is
important; not upon whatâ€™s urgent. If you are fine and in good shape, you can
use your "pen refill" with any pen handle (framework, technology, programming
language, job position, etc.)

Easy enough? I spent years to understand this.
