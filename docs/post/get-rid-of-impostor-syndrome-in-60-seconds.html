        <!-- Description: The most effective way to get rid of impostor syndrome in 60 seconds. Technique based on imaginary and associative thinking. -->


<blockquote>
<p>Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism, is a
psychological experience of intellectual and professional infraudulence. It
is &ldquo;the subjective experience of perceived self-doubt in one&rsquo;s abilities
and accomplishments compared with others, despite evidence to suggest the
contrary.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>If you read this post, then most probably you have already read a lot of
texts about &ldquo;impostor syndrome&rdquo; and you know what it is and how destructive it
might be for your career, life, family, relationships, etc.</p>
<p>I suffered it for many years, it almost ruined my life and career. I read,
maybe, hundreds of articles, consulted with psychologists, and used different
anti-depressants. Nothing helped! Until I accidentally found imaginary
and associative thinking and got healed in one minute. Really!</p>
<p>Enough of words! Let me demonstrate how it works.</p>
<h2 id="guide">Guide</h2>
<p>You are like a pen.</p>
<p><img alt="A pen" src="/assets/img/imp/pen.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can draw and write with it in a very good way (or not so good like me):</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing kitty" src="/assets/img/imp/kitty-pen.jpg" /></p>
<p>The pen consists of two parts: a pen handle and a pen refill. </p>
<p><img alt="Pen-refill and case" src="/assets/img/imp/pen-and-refill.jpg" /></p>
<p>You still can draw and write without the pen handle. Using only a pen refill.
This might be a bit inconvenient, maybe not so good,<br>
<strong>but still can do it!</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Drawing kitty with pen-refill" src="/assets/img/imp/kitty-refill.jpg" /></p>
<p>The pen handle alone is completely useless, you cannot draw even a line without
a pen refill.</p>
<p><img alt="Pen case" src="/assets/img/imp/handle.jpg" /></p>
<p>Your core skills, life force, motivation, and health are like a pen refill. If
it is full and ready to act, then you can find a suitable pen handle and start to
draw and write again. If your pen refill is empty, then even together with a
pen handle these both are useless.</p>
<p><img alt="Pen case" src="/assets/img/imp/handles.jpg" /></p>
<p>Keep your <strong>core</strong> skills up to date, take care of yourself, focus on what is
important; not upon whatâ€™s urgent. If you are fine and in good shape, you can
use your &ldquo;pen refill&rdquo; with any pen handle (framework, technology, programming
language, job position, etc.)</p>
<p>Easy enough? I spent years to understand this.</p>
