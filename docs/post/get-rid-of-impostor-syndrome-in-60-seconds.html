It is “the subjective experience of perceived self-doubt in one’s abilities and accomplishments compared with others, despite evidence to suggest the contrary.”<sup id=fnref:1><a class=footnote-ref href=#fn:1>1</a></sup><ul><li>Wikipedia</ul></blockquote><p>If you read this post, then most probably you have already read a lot of texts about “impostor syndrome” and you know what it is and how destructive it might be for your career, life, family, relationships, etc.<p>I suffered it for many years, it almost ruined my life and career. I read, maybe, hundreds of articles, consulted with psychologists, and used different anti-depressants. Nothing helped! Until I accidentally found imaginary and associative thinking and got healed in one minute. Really!<p>Enough of words! Let me demonstrate how it works.<h2 id=guide>Guide<a title="Permanent link" class=headerlink href=#guide>#</a></h2><p>You are like a pen.<p><img alt="A pen" src=/assets/img/imp/pen.jpg><p>You can draw and write with it in a very good way (or not so good like me):<p><img alt="Drawing kitty" src=/assets/img/imp/kitty-pen.jpg><p>The pen consists of two parts: a pen handle and a pen refill.<p><img alt="Pen-refill and case" src=/assets/img/imp/pen-and-refill.jpg><p>You still can draw and write without the pen handle. Using only a pen refill. This might be a bit inconvenient, maybe not so good,<br> <strong>but still can do it!</strong><p><img alt="Drawing kitty with pen-refill" src=/assets/img/imp/kitty-refill.jpg><p>The pen handle alone is completely useless, you cannot draw even a line without a pen refill.<p><img alt="Pen case" src=/assets/img/imp/handle.jpg><p>Your core skills, life force, motivation, and health are like a pen refill. If it is full and ready to act, then you can find a suitable pen handle and start to draw and write again. If your pen refill is empty, then even together with a pen handle these both are useless.<p><img alt="Pen case" src=/assets/img/imp/handles.jpg><p>Keep your <strong>core</strong> skills up to date, take care of yourself, focus on what is important; not upon what’s urgent. If you are fine and in good shape, you can use your “pen refill” with any pen handle (framework, technology, programming language, job position, etc.)<p>Easy enough? I spent years to understand this.<h2 id=references>References<a title="Permanent link" class=headerlink href=#references>#</a></h2><div class=footnote><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome>Wikipedia: Impostor syndrome</a> <a title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text" class=footnote-backref href=#fnref:1>↩</a></p></ol></div><h2>Feedback</h2><p>For feedback, please check the <a href=/me/>contacts</a> section.
