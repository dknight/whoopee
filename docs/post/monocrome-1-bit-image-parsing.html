There was need to parse 1-bit data from bitmap (*.bmp) image to bytes for input to C.<p>I haven’t found anything suitable on the web that time (2014?).

This makes parsing extremely easy.<p>Check <a href=https://github.com/dknight/bmp2bytes/>bmp2bytes</a> to parse the 1-bit images and get image data and header.<h2 id=example>Example<a title="Permanent link" class=headerlink href=#example>#</a></h2><p><img alt="Girl 1-bit" src=/assets/img/girl.bmp><div class=codehilite><pre><span></span><code>bmp2bytes<span class=w> </span>-f<span class=w> </span><span class=s2>"0x%x"</span><span class=w> </span>-d<span class=w> </span><span class=s2>","</span><span class=w> </span>-n<span class=w> </span>./tests/girl.bmp
