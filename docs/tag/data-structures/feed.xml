  <title>Circular doubly linked list</title>
  <link>https://www.whoop.eepost/circular-doubly-linked-list.html</link>
  <description>Circular doubly linked list is a data structure that is a combination of both circular singly linked list and doubly linked list. It stores 2 pointers, one is pointing to the next node, the other to the previous node and the first pointer points to the last and correspondingly last to the first. This approach makes a continual circular loop. </description>
