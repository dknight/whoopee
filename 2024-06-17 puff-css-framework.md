# Puff lightweight CSS framework

The idea behind the [**puff**](/puff/) project is to keep everything as minimal
as possible. The main rules for the project are:

- Keep everything as minimal as possible.
- Be on the edge, use the latest browser/prototyped technologies.
- The maximum gzipped bundle size is about 2 kilobytes.
- No backward compatibility is needed.
- Polyfills are not allowed.

[Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) is used as a bundler, it seems that
this is the fastest and the most adequate solution for CSS projects.

Finally, I achieved more or less a good result.
