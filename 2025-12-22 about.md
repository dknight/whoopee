This is a personal website. A quiet place. Or at least an attempt at one.

I’ve been working as a Front-End Engineer for more than twenty years. That’s a 
long time on the web. Long enough to remember when things felt smaller and 
more human, even when they were broken. Now everything is louder, faster, 
optimized, measured. I’ve built interfaces, UI systems, and products 
professionally for years, but this site is none of that. It’s not a portfolio. 
It’s not a brand. It’s not trying to convert you into anything. 

I’m not trying to teach anyone. I’m not trying to persuade or sell. I’m not 
chasing engagement or growth. Some posts will be technical. Some personal. 
Some unfinished. Some probably unnecessary. That’s fine. I don’t want this 
place to feel optimized. I want it to feel real enough.

I’m tired of social networks. Of endless feeds, of algorithms deciding what 
matters today. Of metrics, reactions, takes, hot takes, and the feeling that 
you’re always late to something. The internet produces too much noise. Most of 
it disappears immediately anyway. This website is my way of stepping aside 
from that, even if only for myself.

It’s just a place to write.

## Coding, gaming and creativity

I use coding not only as a job, but as a way to think. And, honestly, as a way 
to survive certain days. When anxiety kicks in, I go back to structured 
things: code, small experiments, refactoring, rewriting the same idea until it 
makes sense again. Sometimes it helps, sometimes not.

I don’t always code. I play games mostly olds or in retro-style. I mess with 
game development and usually leave things unfinished. I draw or write with pen 
and paper when screens get tiring. It all comes from the same need: to slow 
down, focus on one thing, and make something real, even if it doesn’t matter.

Here I write about things I care about, or think I care about at the moment:

- front-end development and long experience with it;
- programming as a mental tool, not just a career;
- games, retro-gaming mechanics, game development;
- creativity outside the screen: sketches, notes, anime drawings;
- technology, simplicity, restraint, and when things go too far.

If someone finds something useful, that’s good. If not, that’s also fine. This small blog is written slowly, without much of a plan.
