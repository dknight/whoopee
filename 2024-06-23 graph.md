# Graph

The graph is a data structure that represents vertices connected by edges and
the connection between them. The graph is one of the fundamental more advanced
data structures. It is widely used for pathfinding, detecting cycles, maps,
social networks and other things where there is a need to model relationships
between entities.

In mathematics, there is a large discipline---**graph theory**.

## Anatomy of the graph

- **Vertices (nodes)** -- main units of the graph, every vertex has a value,
  also it might be an object (table) with extra fields like labels.
- **Edges** -- an imaginable line that connects two vertices (nodes). Edges
  can connect nodes in any order and any direction. As the vertices the edges
  also can be labelled.

## Graph operations

- **Add vertices and/or edges (connect vertices)**
- **Delete vertices and/or edges (disconnect vertices)**
- **Search the vertex of a value**
- **Traversing graph**

Usually DFS (Deep-First Search), BFS (Breadth-First Search) methods to search
and traverse the graph. For even more complex cases, there might be more
advanced algorithms (e.g. taking into account the weight of vertices).

## Types of graphs

There are lots of graph types, some of them pretty rarely used especially in Lua
language, because Lua is an interpreted language and might have performance issues.
For analysis of the graph, it is better to use more performant languages like
C/C++, Rust, Go, Java, etc. and use computers with high calculation power.

### Finite Graphs

It is a graph with a finite number of vertices and edges. The number of edges
and vertices can be calculated.

![Finite Graph](/assets/img/graph-finite.svg)

### Infinite Graph

It is a graph with infinite numbers of vertices and edges. The size of the
graph cannot be calculated and amis for infinity.

![Infinite Graph](/assets/img/graph-infinite.svg)

### Trivial Graph: 

It is the simplest graph with only one vertex and has no edges. Usually,
trival graph is the first step when more complex graphs starts to build. 
Later more edges and vertices can be added.

![Trivial Graph](/assets/img/graph-trivial.svg)

### Simple Graph

It is a graph that contains only one edge between the pair of vertices. 

![Simple Graph](/assets/img/graph-simple.svg)

### Multi Graph

Any graph that contains some parallel edges but doesn’t contain any self-loop
Maps are good example of multi-graphs, where you can achieve point **B** from
point **A** in different ways.

![Multi Graph](/assets/img/graph-multi.svg)

### Null Graph

It is a graph where all vertices are isolated has have no edges. There is no
connection between vertices.

![Null Graph](/assets/img/graph-null.svg)

### Complete (Full) Graph

A graph with **n** vertices is called a complete graph if one vertex is
attached with **n-1** edges or the rest of the vertices in the graph.
In other words, each vertex is connected to others with one edge. A pentagram
is an example of the complete graph.

![Complete Graph](/assets/img/graph-complete.svg)

### Pseudo Graph

A graph with a self-loop and multiple edges is called a pseudo graph. In
comparison to a simple graph, the simple graph does not allow loops. 

![Pseudo Graph](/assets/img/graph-pseudo.svg)

### Regular Graph

A graph is regular if all vertices of the graph are of equal degree. In regular
graphs, every vertex has the same number of edges or neighbors. All complete
graphs are regular.

![Regular Graph](/assets/img/graph-regular.svg)

### Bipartite Graph

A graph **G=(V, E)** is a bipartite graph where its vertices set **V(G)**
can be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint subsets **V1(G)** and **V2(G)**
in such a way that each edge of **E(G)** has one end in **V1(G)** and another
end in **V2(G)**. The partition **V1 ∪ V2 = V** is called the bipartite of **G**.

Here in the figure: **V1(G)={C, D, E, F} and V2(G)={A, B}**

![Bipartite Graph](/assets/img/graph-bipartite.svg)

### Labeled Graph

It is any graph where vertices and/or edges have labels, dates, weights or
any other kind of labels.

![Labeled Graph](/assets/img/graph-labelled.svg)

### Directed Graph (Digraph)

The ordered pair of **(V<sub>i</sub>, V<sub>j</sub>)** means an edge between **V<sub>i</sub>** and
**V<sub>ij</sub>** with an arrow directed from **V<sub>i</sub>** to **V<sub>j</sub>**.

Edges in figure: **E1(A, B), E2(B, C), E3(C, D), E4(D, E), E5(B, E), E6(B, D)**

![Directed Graph](/assets/img/graph-directed.svg)

### Subgraph

A graph **G1=(V1, E1)** is called a subgraph of a graph **G(V, E)** if
**V1(G)** is a subset of **V(G)** and **E1(G)** is a subset of **E(G)** such
that each edge of **G1** has same end vertices as in **G**. In other words,
a subgraph is a part of a graph.

Mathematical equivalent: **G1(V1, E1) ⊆ G(V, E)** or vice versa supergraph
**G(V, E) ⊇ G1(V1, E1)**.

![Subgraphs Examples](/assets/img/graph-subgraph.svg)

### Connected and Disconnected Graph

The graph is connected if there exists at least one path between every pair of
vertices, otherwise graph is disconnected.

![Connected Graph](/assets/img/graph-connected.svg)

![Disconnected Graph](/assets/img/graph-disconnected.svg)
Disconnected Graph

### Cyclic Graph

In a cyclic graph number of vertices should be more than 3, otherwise cyclic
graph is impossible.

Common rule

Vertices:
**V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>...V<sub>n</sub>**

Edges:
**(V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>), (V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>), (V<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>4</sub>)...(V<sub>n</sub>, V<sub>n+1</sub>)**

## Graph class implementation in Lua

Here is a simple implementation of the generic graph with some basic methods.

Class implementation with [OOP principles](/post/object-oriented-programming-in-lua.html) and
[annotations](/post/object-oriented-programming-in-lua.html#annotations).

Methods implemented:

- Add vertices
- Add edge
- DFS
- BFS
- Is empty
- Is bipartite
- Is trivial
- size
- Contains vertex
- Calculate adjacency matrix

!!! caution
    Due to Lua language features in the implementation below a graph's vertex 
    cannot be `nil`.

!!! tip
    In the large graphs there might be issues with performance using
    `Graph:BFS()` method. Due to implementation uses `table` module functions.
    To avoid performance issues with elements shifting try 
    [`Queue class`](/post/queue.html).
