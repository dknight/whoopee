<!-- Description: By default, Lua does not provide a built-in tool to print the structure of a table. While there are many existing solutions available online, this tutorial will guide you through creating your own custom function to inspect and display Lua tables in a clear and readable format. By implementing this yourself, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Lua tables and how to work with them efficiently. -->
